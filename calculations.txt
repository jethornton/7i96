 Is there a formula that can be used to calculate P from servo period?

Yes, for the stepgen, 1/servo period is a good value
(so 1000 for a 1 ms servo thread and 500 for a 2 ms thread time)

A P value of 1/servo_period means that any position error
in a velocity mode loop (like the stepgen) is corrected by the next
servo thread period.

A value any greater than 1/servo_period will overcorrect 

Would you connect hm2_7i96.0.encoder.00.velocity to pid.3.feedback?

There's a scale issue, the encoder velocity is in RPS but the spindle commanded
velocity is in RPM

I guess the options are to scale everything in RPS (using motions RPS speed
pins) or to scale the encoder feedback velocity to RPM using the scale
component The latter has the advantage of providing a actual RPM number for
display

a fully isolated potentiometer replacement device the SPINX1.
This is a simple small card that takes 3 signals (PWM ENA DIR) and provides a
potentiometer replacement plus isolated FWD REV and ENA outputs.
